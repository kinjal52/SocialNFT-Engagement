### Problem Statement and Proposed Solution

Problem Statement
  •	The majority of NFT marketplaces are transactional instead of interactive, giving buyers little information about NFTs aside from simple descriptions. 
  •	NFT conversations take place on off-platform channels such as Discord and Twitter, resulting in broken engagement and lower marketplace retention. 
  •	Furthermore, the absence of direct interaction between buyers and creators lowers trust in NFT buying

Proposed Solution
  •	Enable users to discuss, ask questions, and interact with NFTs directly on the marketplace.
  •	Increase buyer confidence by allowing real-time Q&A with creators.
  •	Build a stronger marketplace community, transforming NFTs from mere digital assets into meaningful, interactive experiences that connect and engage users.
