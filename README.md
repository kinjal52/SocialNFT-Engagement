# SocialNFT-Engagement

## Module Description  
The **Social NFT Comments & Engagement** component enhances NFT marketplaces by allowing users to **comment, like, and discuss NFTs directly on the platform**. This feature fosters community engagement, improves user retention, and creates a more interactive NFT experience.

## Features  
- **Commenting System** – Users can leave comments on NFTs.  
- **Like System** – Users can like comments to highlight valuable discussions.  
- **Creator Q&A** – Buyers can ask questions, and NFT creators can respond.  
- **Wallet-Based Authentication** – Users must sign in via Web3 wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect).  
- **Real-Time Updates** – Comments and likes update instantly.  
- **Moderation Tools** – NFT owners can manage discussions, delete comments, or report spam.  
 
## Problem Statement and Proposed Solution

### Problem Statement
  -	The majority of NFT marketplaces are transactional instead of interactive, giving buyers little information about NFTs aside from simple descriptions. 
  -	NFT conversations take place on off-platform channels such as Discord and Twitter, resulting in broken engagement and lower marketplace retention. 
  -	Furthermore, the absence of direct interaction between buyers and creators lowers trust in NFT buying

### Proposed Solution
  -	Enable users to discuss, ask questions, and interact with NFTs directly on the marketplace.
  -	Increase buyer confidence by allowing real-time Q&A with creators.
  -	Build a stronger marketplace community, transforming NFTs from mere digital assets into meaningful, interactive experiences that connect and engage users.

## Technical Architecture Overview

### TimeLine

| Component     | Technology Used                                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**  | Next.js (React) + ShadCN (UI Components)                 |
| **Backend**   | Next.js API Routes (Node.js) + MongoDB (Database)        |
| **Auth**      | Web3 Wallet Authentication (MetaMask, WalletConnect)     |
| **Storage**   | MongoDB (Comments, Likes) / IPFS (Decentralized Storage) |

### System Flow  
1. User connects wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect).  
2. User posts a comment under an NFT.  
3. Backend verifies wallet authentication and stores comment in MongoDB.  
4. Other users can **like, reply, or report** comments.  
5. NFT creator can **respond to buyer questions** directly.  
6. **Moderation tools** allow NFT owners to manage discussions.
